This folder deploys the full stack with Docker Compose:

| Service    | Image / build              | Role                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine`       | Relational store (users, conversations, KBs, usage). |
| `redis`    | `redis:7-alpine`           | Cache, rate-limit counters, cross-process stop-stream pub/sub. |
| `qdrant`   | `qdrant/qdrant:v1.12.4`    | Vector search for RAG.                  |
| `sandbox`  | `ghcr.io/hjxwz123/auven-sandbox-sidecar` | Bundled code-execution sandbox (internal-only). |
| `app`      | `ghcr.io/hjxwz123/auven-app` *(or local build via `Dockerfile.app`)* | One container serving BOTH the built SPA and the `/api` backend on the same origin. |

See the [root README](../README.md) for the full project overview; this file is
just the deployment cheat-sheet.

## How backend selection works

The API binary is the **same** one used in local dev. It picks each backend by
inspecting an environment URL at boot:

- `DATABASE_URL=postgres://…` → Postgres (via the `pgcompat` driver); anything
  else (e.g. a `*.db` path) → embedded SQLite.
- `REDIS_URL` set → Redis; unset → in-process memory cache.
- `QDRANT_URL` set → Qdrant; unset → vector search disabled, RAG injects the
  full in-scope document text as a fallback.

So **nothing needs to be installed locally** to run the app — leave those URLs
unset and it runs on SQLite + memory + full-context RAG fallback. This compose
file sets all three, and Docker deployments use Qdrant by default.

Chunk vectors are stored only in Qdrant. The relational database stores chunk
text and retrieval metadata, which lets the retriever validate Qdrant hits and
fall back to full-context injection if Qdrant is unavailable or empty. Deleting
a document/KB/conversation removes its points from Qdrant too.

## First deploy (prebuilt images)

```bash
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set POSTGRES_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD, and JWT_SECRET at minimum.
# There is NO domain/CORS/port env to set — the app serves the SPA and /api on
# one origin, so whatever host it's reached on works (multiple domains included).
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

The app is then on `http://<host>` (host port 80 by default; change the
`"80:8787"` mapping in `docker-compose.prod.yml` if 80 is taken). On first launch
the deployment has zero users — the FIRST account you create via the setup screen
becomes the administrator. Then add real provider channels in **/admin** (their
API keys are stored in the database).

`store.Migrate()` runs automatically on boot and creates the Postgres schema
(`schema_pg.sql`) if the tables don't exist — no manual SQL step.

## Build the images locally

When iterating on the codebase, or on an architecture not covered by the
official images:

```bash
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

The compose file declares both `image:` and `build:`, so Compose prefers the
prebuilt image when present and falls back to a local build otherwise.

## Embedding dimension

Qdrant uses one collection per embedding width (`auven_c<dim>`). If you
configure a real embedding model, set `EMBEDDING_DIM` (and/or the model's `dim`
in the admin UI) to match — otherwise the local 256-dim embedder is used and
its collection won't match a 1536-dim model's vectors.

## TLS & domains

The `app` container serves plain HTTP on host port 80. For public deployments put
a TLS terminator (Caddy, Traefik, or a cloud LB) in front of it. Because the SPA
and `/api` share one origin, there is **nothing to configure per domain** — point
as many domains as you like at the proxy and each one works, as long as the proxy
forwards the `Host` header (every reverse proxy does by default). No
`PUBLIC_ORIGIN` / `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

## Backups

Persisted in named volumes: `pgdata`, `redisdata`, `qdrantdata`. Uploads and
artifacts are bind-mounted from `DATA_DIR` (default `./data`). Back these up
together so vectors, rows and files stay consistent.

The admin **Backup & Migration** page also creates async full migration archives
for Docker deployments. Those ZIPs include the logical database dump, optional
uploads/artifacts, and Qdrant vectors, and are stored under `BACKUP_DIR`
(default `/app/data/backups`, visible on the host as `DATA_DIR/backups`).
Backup import accepts up to `MAX_BACKUP_BYTES` bytes (default 20 GiB).
